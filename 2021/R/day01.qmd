## Setup

Import libraries:

```{r setup}

library(tidyverse)

```

Read input from file:

```{r}

input <- read_lines("../input/day01.txt") |> as.integer()

```

## Part 1

Define a function to count the number of increasing values in a sequence:

```{r}

count_incr <- \(x) sum(x - lag(x) > 0, na.rm = TRUE)

```

Run on input:

```{r}

count_incr(input)

```

## Part 2

Count increases for 3-measurement windows:

```{r}

count_incr(input + lead(input) + lead(input, 2))

```
