## Setup

Import libraries:

```{r setup}

library(tidyverse)

```

Read text input from file into a data frame:

```{r}

input <- read_table("../input/day01.txt", col_names = c("x", "y"))

```

## Part 1

Sort each list independently, then sum the distances between each pair of ordered items:

```{r}

sum(abs(sort(input$x) - sort(input$y)))

```

## Part 2

For each item in list `x`, multiply its value by its number of occurrences in list `y`, then sum the total. Since an `x` value occurring 0 times in list `y` doesn't contribute to the total, we can just filter `y` to the values also in `x` and sum the result:

```{r}

sum(keep(input$y, \(y) y %in% input$x))

```
