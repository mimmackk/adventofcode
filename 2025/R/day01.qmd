## Setup

Import libraries:

```{r setup}

library(tidyverse)
library(unglue)

```

Read text input from file and convert into a vector of positive (R) or negative (L) numbers:

```{r}

input <- read_lines("../input/day01.txt") |> 
  unglue_data("{dir=L|R}{num=\\d+}", convert = TRUE) |> 
  mutate(num = case_match(dir, "R" ~ num, "L" ~ -num)) |> 
  pull(num)

```

## Part 1

Starting from 50, apply all rotations in sequence as additions modulo 100:

```{r}

dial <- accumulate(input, .f = \(x, y) (x + y) %% 100, .init = 50)

```

Count the number of zeroes in the resulting sequence:

```{r}

dial |> 
  keep(\(x) x == 0) |> 
  length()

```
