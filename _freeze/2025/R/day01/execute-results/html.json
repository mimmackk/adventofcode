If the rotation is negative (L direction), we convert the negative to a symmetrical positive rotation, starting instead at the modular complement of the dial's starting position. \n\nFor example, starting at 1 and rotating left twice is equivalent to starting at 99 and rotating right twice (only in terms of the number of passes over zero).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndial_start <- head(dial, -1)\nnum_passes <- (((sign(rotation) * dial_start) %% 100) + abs(rotation)) %/% 100\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nCount the total times zero is passed:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(num_passes)\n```\n:::\n",
