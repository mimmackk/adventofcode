## Setup

Import libraries:

```{r setup}

library(tidyverse)

```

Read and parse text input from file:

```{r}

input <- scan("../input/day01.txt")

```

## Part 1

Create every combination of numbers, determine which sum to 2020, and take their product:

```{r}

combn(input, m = 2, simplify = FALSE) |> 
  keep(~ sum(.x) == 2020) |> 
  map_dbl(prod)

```

## Part 2

Repeat as above, but take combinations 3 at a time:

```{r}

combn(input, m = 3, simplify = FALSE) |> 
  keep(~ sum(.x) == 2020) |> 
  map_dbl(prod)

```
